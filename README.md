IRCcloud App
============

I really like to have chat apps separate from my browser, primarily so that
they can continue running whenever I (rarely) have to restart the browser
or it crashes.

[IRCcloud](https://www.irccloud.com) is a great IRC bouncer and chat app in
one.

How To
======

1. Clone it.
2. `bundle install`
3. `bundle exec rake`
4. `bundle exec rake open`
5. `bundle exec rake install`

You may be able to leave off the `bundle exec` part. YMMV.
